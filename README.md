# Deep Learning Model for Deconvolution of Temporal Point Spread Function (TPSF) from Instrument Response Function (IRF)
This repository consists of the following components:

## 1.Simulation-based Temporal Point Spread Function (TPSF) Generation for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLI)
    a. IRF generated from time-gated Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD)
    b. IRF generated from time-gated Intensified Charge-Coupled Device (ICCD)
    c. IRF generated from Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC)

## 2.Deep Learning Model
    A GRU-based Seq2Seq model for fast deconvolution and parameter estimation.
